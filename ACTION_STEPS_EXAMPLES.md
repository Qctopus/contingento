**Jamaica-Specific Context:**

### Step 5: Equipment Replacement Fund
**Jamaica-Specific Context:**
- **Amount:** Save JMD 5,000-10,000 monthly

## ⚡ Backup Power

### Step 1: Store Fuel Supply
**Jamaica-Specific Context:**
- **Amount:** Keep 20-40 gallons gasoline or diesel in safe containers

- **Storage:** Approved containers, cool ventilated area away from building
- **Rotation:** Use and replace every 3 months (fuel degrades in heat)

### Step 2: Buy Appropriate Generator
**Jamaica-Specific Context:**

- **Why:** "Ocho Rios boutique used cash reserves for Hurricane Beryl repairs - reopened in 1 week instead of waiting 6 weeks for insurance"
- **Separate Account:** Don't mix with operating funds
- **Reality:** "Without emergency fund, forced to close during slow period or take high-interest loans"
