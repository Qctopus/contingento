## Bottom Line

**Before:** A skeleton BCP that missed most of the data collected.

**After:** A comprehensive, professional, standards-compliant BCP that uses every piece of information the business owner provided.

**Result:** Business owners get real value from completing the wizard — a document they can actually use, share with stakeholders, and be proud of.

🎯 **Mission Accomplished:** Every question in the wizard now has a purpose!
