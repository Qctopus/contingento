# Common Mistakes - FIXED ✅

## 🎯 Issue Resolved

**Problem:** All 13 strategies had the same generic "Common Mistakes to Avoid":
- ✗ Waiting too long to implement
- ✗ Not testing the plan
- ✗ Forgetting to update contacts

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Every strategy now has **4 specific, relevant common mistakes** instead of generic ones.

### Examples:

**Hurricane Preparation (Before → After):**
```diff
- Waiting too long to implement
- Not testing the plan
- Forgetting to update contacts
+ Waiting until hurricane is announced to prepare - supplies sell out fast
+ Not securing outdoor items that become projectiles in high winds
+ Forgetting to photograph assets before storm for insurance claims
+ Storing all backup supplies in same location that could flood
```

**Flood Prevention:**
```
✗ Ignoring small leaks and drainage issues until major flooding occurs
✗ Storing valuable inventory on ground level in flood-prone areas
✗ Not checking drains before rainy season
✗ Assuming insurance covers all flood damage without reading policy
```

**Backup Power:**
```
✗ Buying generator without calculating actual power needs - too small to run business
✗ Not testing generator monthly - it fails when you need it most
✗ Running out of fuel during extended outage
✗ No transfer switch - risking electrocution or equipment damage
```

**Cybersecurity:**
```
✗ Using same password for all accounts - one breach compromises everything
✗ Clicking links in unexpected emails - 90% of cyber attacks start with phishing
✗ No offline backups - ransomware encrypts online backups too
✗ Ignoring software updates that fix security holes
```

**Fire Detection:**
```
✗ Installing smoke alarms but never changing batteries - 30% don't work when needed
✗ Wrong type of fire extinguisher for your business (kitchen needs Class K)
✗ Blocking fire exits with storage or displays
✗ No staff training - extinguishers sit unused during small fires
```

**Financial Resilience:**
```
✗ No emergency fund - forced to close during slow period or after disaster
✗ Taking all profits out - nothing left for repairs or restocking
✗ High-interest credit cards as only backup - debt spiral after emergency
✗ Not tracking cash flow - surprised by shortages
```

**Communication Backup:**
```
✗ Only having digital contact list - useless when power/internet is down
✗ Not testing backup communication methods before emergency
✗ Assuming cell phones will work during major disasters - towers often fail
✗ No communication plan for staff/suppliers/customers
```

**Health & Safety:**
```
✗ Sick staff working with food/customers - spreads disease and loses business
✗ Sharing equipment without sanitizing between users
✗ No hand washing enforcement - visible to customers who lose trust
✗ Ignoring Ministry of Health notices - fines and closures
```

## 📝 Display Note

If a strategy appears to "cut off" after Common Mistakes, it's because that strategy has no action steps defined yet (communication_backup and equipment_maintenance have 0 steps currently). This is not a display bug - it's just that those strategies need action steps added.
