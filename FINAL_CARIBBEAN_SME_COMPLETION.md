## 🆕 Newly Added Strategies

### 1. Communication Backup Systems (4 steps)

**Caribbean Context:**
- References **Hurricane Beryl 2024** when cell towers failed for days
- Includes **Digicel and Flow** (local mobile providers)
- Mentions **JPS, NWC, Jamaica Fire Brigade, JCF** contacts
- WhatsApp groups (worked during 2024 storms)
- Walkie-talkies for when networks fail

**Sample Step:**
> **"Create printed emergency contact list"**  
> Create laminated cards with JPS, NWC, Jamaica Fire Brigade, JCF numbers. Digital contacts are useless when cell towers fail - Hurricane Beryl proved this.  
> 💰 JMD 500-2,000 | ⏱️ 2 days | 👤 Business Owner

### 2. Critical Equipment Maintenance (5 steps)

**Caribbean Context:**
- Addresses **Jamaica's heat and humidity** that kills equipment fast
- Mentions **Cool Breeze, Arctic** (local HVAC companies)
- Includes **Courts, Singer** for purchasing equipment
- References **weekly cleaning** to extend lifespan by 50%
- JMD equipment replacement fund strategy

**Sample Step:**
> **"Schedule weekly cleaning and visual inspections"**  
> Every Friday: Clean filters, check leaks, unusual sounds. Jamaica's heat and humidity kill equipment fast - weekly cleaning extends lifespan by 50%. A JMD 10,000 fridge repair avoided is profit saved.  
> 💰 JMD 500-2,000 | ⏱️ Start this week | 👤 All Staff
