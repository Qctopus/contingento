## 📊 Content Quality: Before vs After

### BEFORE (All Strategies Had Same Content) ❌
```
Benefits:
• Reduce risk and protect assets
• Maintain business continuity
• Meet compliance requirements

Real World: A small retail business implemented this strategy...

Low Budget: Start with free cloud backup solutions...

Common Mistakes:
✗ Waiting too long to implement
✗ Not testing the plan
✗ Forgetting to update contacts
```

### AFTER (Each Strategy is Unique) ✅

**Hurricane Preparation:**
```
Benefits:
• Protect your building and inventory from hurricane damage
• Reduce repair costs and downtime after storms
• Keep staff and customers safe during severe weather

Real World: A hardware store in Montego Bay installed hurricane shutters. 
When Hurricane Beryl hit in 2024, they reopened within 2 days while 
competitors took weeks.

Low Budget: Use plywood boards (JMD 5,000-15,000) instead of metal 
shutters (JMD 30,000-50,000).

Common Mistakes:
✗ Waiting until hurricane is announced - supplies sell out fast
✗ Not securing outdoor items that become projectiles
✗ Forgetting to photograph assets for insurance claims
✗ Storing all backup supplies in same flood-prone location
```

**Cybersecurity:**
```
Benefits:
• Protect customer payment card data and business information
• Prevent ransomware attacks that can shut down operations
• Maintain customer trust and comply with data protection laws

Real World: A pharmacy in Portmore faced ransomware. With offline backups 
and antivirus, they restored systems in 4 hours instead of paying 
JMD 500,000 ransom.

Low Budget: Free antivirus (Windows Defender) and free cloud backup 
(Google Drive 15GB) vs paid security suite (JMD 15,000-30,000/year).

Common Mistakes:
✗ Using same password for all accounts - one breach compromises everything
✗ Clicking links in unexpected emails - 90% of attacks start with phishing
✗ No offline backups - ransomware encrypts online backups too
✗ Ignoring software updates that fix security holes
```
