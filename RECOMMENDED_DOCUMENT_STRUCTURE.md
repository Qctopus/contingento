│ 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS TO YOUR BUSINESS                          │
│ Your retail store has:                                       │
│ • Large glass windows facing the street (vulnerable)         │
│ • Outdoor signage that can become projectiles               │
│ • Refrigerated inventory worth JMD 150,000+                 │
│ • Located in coastal area (higher wind speeds)              │
│                                                               │
│ If you're not prepared:                                      │
│ • Windows shatter → inventory ruined by water               │
│ • Sign tears off → damages neighboring buildings (liable!)   │
│ • Power out for days → entire fridge stock spoils           │
│ • Lost revenue: JMD 300,000-500,000 per week closed         │

│ │ WHAT YOU GET:                                           │ │
│ │ ✓ Protect windows from flying debris and wind          │ │
│ │ ✓ Prevent water damage to inventory                    │ │
│ │ ✓ Reduce insurance premiums by 15-25%                  │ │
│ │ ✓ Peace of mind during storm season                    │ │
│ │                                                         │ │
│ │ INVESTMENT: JMD 45,000-80,000 (one-time)              │ │
│ │ TIME TO SETUP: 4-6 hours before storm                  │ │
│ │                                                         │ │

│ │ REAL EXAMPLE:                                           │ │
│ │ Parish Pharmacy in Montego Bay installed aluminum      │ │
│ │ hurricane shutters in 2023 (cost: JMD 65,000).         │ │
│ │ During Hurricane Beryl (July 2024), their windows      │ │
│ │ stayed intact while 3 nearby shops had extensive       │ │
│ │ damage. They reopened in 2 days vs competitors'        │ │
│ │ 3 weeks. Insurance premium dropped from JMD 45,000     │ │
│ │ to JMD 35,000/year (JMD 10,000 annual savings).       │ │
│ │ Shutters paid for themselves in 7 years.               │ │

## WHY THIS STRUCTURE WORKS

### 1. **Risk-Centric = Natural Mental Model**
Small business owners think: "What's my biggest threat?" not "What are all the strategies?"

### 2. **Everything About One Risk in One Place**
Don't make them flip between "Section 3: Strategies" and "Section 4: Actions" to understand how to protect against hurricanes.

### 3. **Clear Priority**
EXTREME risks first → HIGH risks → MEDIUM risks → LOW risks
They tackle biggest threats first with their limited budget.

### 4. **Integrated Decision-Making**
For each risk, they see:
- The threat
- Why it matters to THEM specifically
- ALL the options (budget to premium)
- Exact costs for each option
- How to actually do it
- Total investment needed

They can make ONE decision: "For hurricanes, I'll do Option B (plywood) for now, upgrade to Option A (shutters) next year."

### 5. **Total Cost Per Risk**
At the end of each risk section, they see: "To fully protect against hurricanes: JMD 58,000 minimum, JMD 145,000 recommended"

This lets them budget properly.

## CONTENT FROM YOUR DATABASE

### For Each Risk, Pull:

```javascript
// 1. Risk Profile
- Risk level (EXTREME/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Likelihood (from parish + business type data)
- Impact (from business type vulnerability)
- Risk score calculation
- WHY it matters to THIS business (reasoning field)

// 2. Applicable Strategies (filter by applicableRisks)
const relevantStrategies = strategies.filter(s => 
  s.applicableRisks.includes(risk.hazardId)
)

// 3. For Each Strategy:
- smeTitle (benefit-driven name)
- smeSummary (what they get)
- benefitsBullets (specific benefits)
- costEstimateJMD (what it costs)
- realWorldExample (success story)
- lowBudgetAlternative (if can't afford full)
- quickWinIndicator (flag high-value items)

// 4. Action Steps (grouped by phase)
const steps = strategy.actionSteps.sort((a, b) => a.sortOrder - b.sortOrder)
const beforeSteps = steps.filter(s => s.phase === 'immediate')
const duringSteps = steps.filter(s => s.phase === 'short_term')
const afterSteps = steps.filter(s => s.phase === 'medium_term')

// 5. For Each Step:
- title
- smeAction (what to do)
- timeframe (how long)
- responsibility (who does it)
- estimatedCostJMD (cost for this step)
- checklist (sub-tasks)
- howToKnowItsDone (completion criteria)
- commonMistakesForStep (warnings)
- freeAlternative (if applicable)
```

## SMART CONTENT DECISIONS

### 1. **Business-Specific Reasoning**
Don't show generic "hurricanes are bad."

Show: "YOUR retail store has large glass windows and JMD 150,000 in refrigerated inventory. A hurricane could shatter those windows, flooding your store and spoiling everything. You'd lose JMD 300,000+ in lost sales plus inventory replacement."

Use business type + parish data to generate this.

### 2. **Risk Comparison**
At the start of Section 2:

```
YOUR TOP THREATS (In Order):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Hurricane (EXTREME - 9/10)               │
│    Potential loss: JMD 500,000+             │
│    Protection cost: JMD 145,000              │
│                                              │
│ 2. Power Outage (HIGH - 7/10)               │
│    Potential loss: JMD 50,000/day            │
│    Protection cost: JMD 65,000               │
│                                              │
│ 3. Flooding (HIGH - 6/10)                    │
│    Potential loss: JMD 200,000               │
│    Protection cost: JMD 45,000               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Total recommended investment: JMD 255,000
to protect against your top 3 threats.

Can't afford it all? Start with Risk #1 (Hurricane).
```

### 3. **Phased Implementation**
For each strategy, show:

```
BUDGET APPROACH (Start with JMD 20,000):
Year 1: Plywood shutters
Year 2: Upgrade to aluminum shutters
Year 3: Add automatic system

FULL PROTECTION (Pay JMD 80,000 now):
Everything at once
```

## EXAMPLE: How Database Content Flows

### Database Query:
```javascript
// Get business profile
const business = getBusinessProfile(userId)

// Get applicable risks
const risks = getRisksForBusinessAndLocation(
  business.businessTypeId,
  business.parishId
)

// For each HIGH/EXTREME risk
risks.filter(r => r.riskLevel >= 6).forEach(risk => {
  
  // Get why it matters to THIS business
  const reasoning = generateBusinessSpecificReasoning(
    risk,
    business.businessType,
    business.essentialFunctions
  )
  
  // Get strategies that address this risk
  const strategies = getStrategiesForRisk(risk.hazardId)
  
  // For each strategy
  strategies.forEach(strategy => {
    // Get all action steps
    const steps = getActionStepsForStrategy(strategy.id)
    
    // Organize by phase
    const organized = {
      before: steps.filter(s => s.phase === 'immediate'),
      during: steps.filter(s => s.phase === 'short_term'),
      after: steps.filter(s => s.phase === 'medium_term')
    }
    
    // Render complete risk section
    renderRiskSection({
      risk,
      reasoning,
      strategy,
      steps: organized
    })
  })
})
```

## RECOMMENDATION

**Completely refactor BusinessPlanReview.tsx to generate this structure:**

1. Group by RISK (not by strategy category)
2. For each risk, show ALL relevant strategies together
3. For each strategy, show benefits + costs + exact steps
4. Organize steps by WHEN (before/during/after), not by abstract "phase"
5. Show total cost to address each risk
6. Prioritize risks by score

This gives business owners ONE place to answer: "What do I do about hurricanes?" with everything they need to know.

Does this make sense now?
