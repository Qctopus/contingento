## 📊 What Was Fixed

### Before ❌
```
Protect Your Business from Disasters
This strategy helps protect your business by {"en":"Protect your building...","es":"Proteja su..."}

Step 1: Step 2
Who is responsible: [BLANK]
Cost: [BLANK]
```

### After ✅
```
Communication Backup Systems
Ensure business communication continuity when primary systems fail

1. Create printed emergency contact list
   Create laminated cards with JPS, NWC, Jamaica Fire Brigade, JCF numbers
   👤 Business Owner | ⏱️ 2 days | 💰 JMD 500-2,000
   
   💡 Why: Hurricane Beryl 2024 proved digital contacts are useless when 
   cell towers fail for days. Having laminated cards in 3 locations 
   (office, vehicle, home) ensures you can reach emergency services 
   and suppliers even without power.
