# Strategy Content Guidelines
## Writing Effective SME-Focused Strategy Content for Caribbean Businesses

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

This system is **NOT** a generic disaster planning tool. It's a **Caribbean SME-focused business continuity advisor** that:
- Speaks directly to small business owners in plain language
- Provides realistic, affordable options for resource-limited businesses
- Includes real examples from Caribbean businesses
- Respects cultural and economic context

---

## ✍️ Writing SME Titles

### ✅ DO:
- **Use benefit-driven language**: "Protect Your Business from Hurricane Damage"
- **Address the business owner directly**: "Your", "You Can"
- **Focus on outcomes**: What they achieve, not what they do
- **Keep it conversational**: Like talking to a friend

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Use technical jargon**: "Hurricane Preparedness & Property Protection"
- **Be formal or corporate**: "Implementation of Storm Mitigation Strategies"
- **Use passive voice**: "Strategies for Hurricane Protection"
- **Make it about the process**: "How to Prepare for Hurricanes"

### Examples:
```
❌ Data Backup and Recovery Systems
✅ Protect Your Business Records from Disasters

❌ Emergency Financial Reserve Management
✅ Build a Cash Reserve for When Disaster Strikes

❌ Supply Chain Risk Mitigation Procedures
✅ Never Run Out of Stock Because One Supplier Failed
```

---

## 📝 Writing SME Summaries

**Goal**: One or two sentences that explain WHY this matters in plain language.

### Formula:
1. **State the problem** (what Caribbean SMEs face)
2. **Show the solution** (what this strategy does)
3. **Promise the outcome** (what they'll achieve)

### ✅ Good Examples:
```
"Power outages are common in the Caribbean - from storms to grid failures. 
Having backup power means you can keep serving customers, protect perishables, 
and maintain security when others go dark."

"Flash floods can ruin inventory, damage equipment, and close your business 
for weeks. Simple flood prevention saves thousands in losses and gets you 
back in business faster."
```

### ❌ Bad Examples:
```
"This strategy addresses the implementation of comprehensive backup power 
systems for business continuity."
→ Problem: Corporate speak, no Caribbean context, doesn't say WHY

"Flooding is a risk that should be mitigated through proper preparation."
→ Problem: Passive, vague, no specific benefits
```

---

## ✅ Writing Benefit Bullets

**Goal**: 3-5 concrete outcomes that a business owner cares about.

### Rules:
1. Start with **action verbs** or outcomes
2. Focus on **business results** (money, time, customers)
3. Be **specific** - avoid vague terms
4. Make it **personal** - "your staff", "your inventory"

### ✅ Good Examples:
```
• Reopen faster than competitors after the storm
• Protect expensive equipment and stock
• Stay open and making money during power outages
• Keep customers confident with visible safety measures
```

### ❌ Bad Examples:
```
• Improved operational resilience
→ Problem: Vague, corporate speak

• Reduced vulnerability to supply chain disruptions
→ Problem: Technical, doesn't say what owner gets

• Enhanced preparedness levels
→ Problem: Meaningless - "enhanced" how?
```

## 💚 Writing Real Caribbean Success Stories

**⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT include hardcoded costs in success stories!**

See `docs/HARDCODED_COSTS_REMOVAL_GUIDE.md` for detailed guidance on costs.

**Goal**: Show a real Caribbean business that benefited from this strategy with impact and context.

### Required Elements:
1. **Location** - Specific Caribbean town/parish
2. **Business type** - What kind of business
3. **Year/event** - When this happened (recent is better)
4. **Impact described** - What happened vs what would have happened (NO specific costs)
5. **Clear outcome** - The benefit without dollar amounts

### Template:
```
[Event] happened in [Location] in [Year]. [Business type] that had 
[this strategy] [positive outcome - impact described]. [Business without 
strategy] [negative outcome - losses described]. [Cost of strategy] 
paid for itself quickly.
```

### ✅ Good Example:
```
"A pharmacy in May Pen installed a backup generator in 2023. 
During a 3-day outage in July, they were the only pharmacy open in the area. 
They made significant extra sales while competitors lost inventory to 
spoilage. The generator paid for itself in one weekend."
```

**Why it works**:
- Specific place (May Pen)
- Specific business (pharmacy)
- Specific time (2023, July)
- Impact described (only one open, extra sales, competitors had losses)
- Clear comparison (they stayed open, others closed)
- Relatable outcome (paid for itself)
- NO hardcoded costs (system provides localized pricing)

### ❌ Bad Example - Hardcoded Costs:
```
"A pharmacy in May Pen installed a JMD 180,000 generator in 2023. 
During a 3-day outage they made JMD 450,000 in extra sales."
```

**Why it fails**:
- Hardcoded JMD amounts don't work for users in Barbados, Trinidad, etc.
- See `HARDCODED_COSTS_REMOVAL_GUIDE.md` for full explanation

### ❌ Bad Example - Too Vague:
```
"Many businesses have found that backup power systems provide significant 
value during outages."
```

**Why it fails**:
- No specific location
- No specific business
- No story
- No Caribbean context

## 💰 Writing About Costs (UPDATED - Multi-Currency System)

**⚠️ CRITICAL CHANGE: DO NOT hardcode currency amounts!**

**See `docs/HARDCODED_COSTS_REMOVAL_GUIDE.md` for complete guidance.**

### ❌ NEVER Write:
- "JMD 15,000-80,000"
- "J$ 45,000"
- "$500-1,000"
- Any currency code + numbers

### ✅ Instead Write:
- "See cost breakdown below"
- "Budget-friendly option"
- "Significant savings"
- "Cost-effective solution"
- Describe what's needed, not the price

### Why This Changed:
We serve **7 Caribbean countries** with different currencies. Hardcoded "JMD" amounts confuse users in Barbados (BBD), Trinidad (TTD), Bahamas (BSD), etc.

### How Costs Work Now:
- Link **cost items** to action steps
- System calculates based on user's country
- Displays in local currency automatically
- Updates with exchange rates

**For complete guidelines, read:** `docs/HARDCODED_COSTS_REMOVAL_GUIDE.md`

---

## 💸 Writing Low Budget Alternatives

**⚠️ DO NOT include hardcoded costs! See `HARDCODED_COSTS_REMOVAL_GUIDE.md`**

**Goal**: Show the cheapest way to implement this, specific to Caribbean SMEs.

### Rules:
1. **Be specific** - exact items needed (NOT prices)
2. **DIY-friendly** - something they can actually do
3. **Still effective** - not just "do nothing"
4. **Caribbean-available** - can buy locally
5. **NO currency amounts** - link cost items instead

### ✅ Good Example:
```
"Start with a small inverter and car batteries to power essentials like 
cash register, internet router, and a few lights. This budget-friendly 
approach costs significantly less than a full generator system while 
covering your critical needs. See cost breakdown for your country's pricing."
```

**Why it works**:
- Specific items (inverter, car batteries)
- Says what it can power
- Notes it's budget-friendly
- Points to cost system for actual pricing
- Works for all Caribbean countries

### ❌ Bad Example - Hardcoded Costs:
```
"Start with a small inverter (JMD 15,000) and car batteries (JMD 10,000 each)..."
```

**Why it fails**:
- Hardcoded JMD amounts don't work for non-Jamaica users
- See `HARDCODED_COSTS_REMOVAL_GUIDE.md`

### ❌ Bad Example - Too Vague:
```
"Consider lower-cost alternatives that may provide adequate protection."
```

**Why it fails**:
- No specifics
- Vague ("consider", "may")
- No guidance

---

## 🔧 Writing DIY Approaches

**⚠️ DO NOT include hardcoded costs! See `HARDCODED_COSTS_REMOVAL_GUIDE.md`**

**Goal**: Step-by-step instructions a business owner can follow themselves.

### Format:
Use numbered steps with specific actions (NO currency amounts).

### ✅ Good Example:
```
"1) Buy plywood sheets and hinges from your local hardware store
2) Cut to fit your windows
3) Paint with exterior paint for weather protection
4) Install simple hinges so they fold down when not needed
This DIY approach costs significantly less than professional metal shutters - 
see the detailed cost breakdown for pricing in your country's currency."
```

**Why it works**:
- Numbered steps
- Specific materials listed
- Clear instructions
- Compares to professional option
- Notes savings without hardcoded amounts
- Points to cost system

### ❌ Bad Example - Hardcoded Costs:
```
"Buy plywood sheets (JMD 8,000), paint (JMD 2,000)..."
```

**Why it fails**:
- Hardcoded JMD costs don't work for other countries
- See `HARDCODED_COSTS_REMOVAL_GUIDE.md`

### ❌ Bad Example - Too Vague:
```
"You can implement this strategy yourself by following standard procedures 
and best practices."
```

**Why it fails**:
- No steps
- No specifics
- No actionable guidance

## 🏭 Writing Industry Variants

**Goal**: Customize the strategy for different Caribbean industries.

### Key Industries:
- **Restaurant** - Food service, bars, cafes
- **Retail** - Shops, boutiques, supermarkets
- **Tourism** - Hotels, guesthouses, tour operators
- **Services** - Salons, mechanics, professionals

### Rules:
1. **Be industry-specific** - use their language
2. **Focus on their pain points** - what they worry about
3. **Mention their assets** - inventory, equipment specific to them
4. **Short and practical** - one or two sentences max

### ✅ Good Examples:
```json
{
  "restaurant": "CRITICAL for refrigeration - losing a freezer of meat/fish 
                 costs thousands. Generator minimum 5kW for fridge, freezer, 
                 lights.",
  
  "retail": "Important for POS systems and lights during business hours. 
             Small inverter may suffice if no refrigeration.",
  
  "tourism": "Essential for guest comfort, security, and reputation. 
              Consider whole-facility backup power."
}
```

---

## 📏 Writing Business Size Guidance

**Goal**: Tailor advice based on business size and resources.

### Categories:
- **Micro** (1-5 employees, ~JMD 500K-2M annual revenue)
- **Small** (6-20 employees, ~JMD 2M-10M annual revenue)
- **Medium** (21-50 employees, ~JMD 10M+ annual revenue)

### ✅ Good Example:
```json
{
  "micro": "Budget-friendly inverter and battery setup. Powers essentials only. See cost breakdown.",
  "small": "Small generator system. Covers critical operations. See cost breakdown.",
  "medium": "Full generator with auto-switch. Complete facility backup. See cost breakdown."
}
```

**Note:** DO NOT include hardcoded costs. Link cost items instead.

## 💡 Writing Helpful Tips

**Goal**: Practical advice that prevents common mistakes.

### Rules:
1. **Specific actions** - not vague advice
2. **Prevent problems** - not just "do this"
3. **Easy to remember** - short and punchy
4. **Caribbean context** - relevant locally

### ✅ Good Examples:
```
• Test your contact list quarterly by sending a quick WhatsApp message
• Check your drains BEFORE rainy season, not during a storm
• Store generator fuel safely away from building - gas goes bad after 6 months
• Practice your quick-close procedure - should take under 15 minutes
```

### ❌ Bad Examples:
```
• Follow best practices for implementation
• Ensure proper maintenance
• Consult with professionals as needed
```

---

## ⚠️ Writing Common Mistakes

**Goal**: Warn about specific errors Caribbean SMEs often make.

### Rules:
1. **Specific mistakes** - actual things people do wrong
2. **Explain consequences** - why it's a mistake
3. **Conversational tone** - like a friend warning you
4. **Caribbean-relevant** - common locally

### ✅ Good Examples:
```
• Taping windows - doesn't work and wastes time. Use shutters or plywood.
• Only storing contacts digitally - if your phone dies, you're stuck
• Waiting until day before to board up - supplies sell out fast
• No backup supplier relationships - they won't help first-time customers in emergency
```

### ❌ Bad Examples:
```
• Inadequate preparation
• Insufficient planning
• Failure to follow procedures
```

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Goal**: Clear, measurable criteria to know if you've succeeded.

### Rules:
1. **Measurable** - can check yes/no
2. **Specific** - not vague goals
3. **Practical** - realistic to achieve
4. **3-5 metrics** - not too many

### ✅ Good Examples:
```
• Can reach 80%+ of contacts within 15 minutes
• Storage for 3+ days minimum operations
• All tall furniture secured to walls
• Working smoke alarm in every room
```

### ❌ Bad Examples:
```
• Improved preparedness
• Enhanced resilience
• Better outcomes
• Adequate protection
```

## 🌴 Caribbean Context

### Cultural Considerations:
- **Direct communication** - Caribbeans appreciate straightforward advice
- **Community-focused** - Mention word-of-mouth, asking neighbors
- **Practical over theoretical** - Show them how, not just why
- **Cost-conscious** - Always provide budget options
- **Relationship-based** - Emphasize building supplier relationships

### Economic Reality:
- **Cash-constrained** - Most SMEs have tight budgets
- **Informal sector** - Many operate informally
- **Limited staff** - Owner does everything in micro businesses
- **Seasonal fluctuations** - Tourism, agriculture vary by season
- **Supply challenges** - Getting materials can be difficult

### Common Tools/Resources:
- **WhatsApp** - Primary business communication
- **Cash/check** - Many still don't use digital payments
- **Local suppliers** - Prefer local over imported when possible
- **DIY culture** - Strong tradition of doing things yourself
- **Family involvement** - Family often helps in business

### Caribbean-Specific Hazards:
- **Hurricane season** - June to November
- **Flooding** - Especially during tropical storms
- **Power outages** - Common, often prolonged
- **Water shortages** - Periodic, especially during drought
- **Supply disruptions** - Shipping delays, import challenges

---

## 📖 Examples of Excellent Content

### Hurricane Preparation Strategy:
```yaml
smeTitle: "Protect Your Business from Hurricane Damage"

smeSummary: "Hurricane season comes every year in the Caribbean. Being prepared 
             means less damage, faster reopening, and protecting the business 
             you've worked hard to build."

benefitsBullets:
  - Reduce property damage and inventory loss
  - Reopen faster than competitors after the storm
  - Protect expensive equipment and stock
  - Keep your family and staff safe during the hurricane

realWorldExample: "When Hurricane Beryl hit Negril in 2024, hardware stores 
                   that had shutters and moved stock away from windows were open 
                   within days. Those that didn't prepare had weeks of cleanup and 
                   significant damage. One shop owner said: 'The shutters I installed 
                   saved me substantial costs in broken glass and water damage.'"

lowBudgetAlternative: "DIY plywood shutters work almost as well as metal ones 
                       and cost much less. Tape can't stop a hurricane, but plastic 
                       sheeting inside windows catches glass if they break. See cost 
                       breakdown for materials pricing."

diyApproach: "1) Buy plywood sheets and hinges. 2) Cut to fit your windows. 
              3) Paint with exterior paint for weather protection. 4) Install simple 
              hinges so they fold down when not needed. This DIY approach costs 
              significantly less than professional metal shutters - see cost breakdown."
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### DON'T:
1. **Use corporate speak** - "implement comprehensive mitigation strategies"
2. **Be vague** - "take appropriate measures"
3. **Ignore costs** - "invest in proper equipment"
4. **Assume resources** - "hire a consultant"
5. **Use generic examples** - "many businesses find this useful"
6. **Forget Caribbean context** - examples from US/Europe
7. **Be overly technical** - "deploy redundant infrastructure"
8. **Use passive voice** - "procedures should be established"

---

## ✅ Content Review Process

Before finalizing content:

1. **Read it aloud** - Does it sound natural?
2. **Show it to a business owner** - Do they understand it?
3. **Check costs** - Are JMD amounts realistic?
4. **Verify locations** - Are places real and correct?
5. **Test instructions** - Can someone follow the DIY steps?
6. **Check language** - Is it conversational and clear?
7. **Verify Caribbean context** - Is it locally relevant?

---

## 📞 Questions?

When in doubt:
- **Simpler is better** - Clarity over sophistication
- **Specific is better** - "JMD 15,000" not "low cost"
- **Local is better** - "May Pen" not "a town"
- **Conversational is better** - "You can" not "One should"

**Remember**: You're writing for a busy Caribbean business owner who needs practical, affordable, actionable advice. Not for academics or consultants.
